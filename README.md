You may save these events by either marking them as "Going!" or "Interested" if you sure you aren't committed to an event yet. 
Navigate to the "My Events" section to access the events you are attending.
Navigate to the "Interested" section to access events that you are on the fence about. From here you can decide to either remove the event or mark it as attending. <br>
